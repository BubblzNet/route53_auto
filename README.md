# Route53Auto

Welcome to Route53Auto.
The purpose of this gem is to automatically aliase your dns with your domain name with AWS.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'route53_auto'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install route53_auto

## Configuration

**First Method**

Add as environment variables:

`AMAZON_REGION = 'your-region-1'`

`AMAZON_ACCESS_KEY = 'your-access-key'`

`AMAZON_SECRET_ACCESS = 'your-secret-access-key'`


**Second method**

If you have your credentials stored here `~/.aws/credentials`
create a profile called `ec2`

And prototype it like this ->
```
[ec2]
aws_access_key_id = youraccesskey
aws_secret_access_key = yoursecretaccesskey
```
**If your ec2 server is located somewhere else than `eu-west-1`, please fill up `AMAZON_REGION` variable**


## Usage

Make sure you have auto-scaling disabled on your ec2 instance.


Use your instance-id and your domaine name to link `route = Route53.new('i-yourid', 'your.domain-name.com')`

It will aliase your dns with your domaine name
